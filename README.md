# Easy-GE
A python install script, that allows for an easier installation of proton-ge-custom.

## Usage
To use this script, you first need to clone the repository into any directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexklann/easy-ge.git
cd easy-ge
```

After that, you have to make the script executable.

```bash
chmod +x easyge
```

And now you can run the script.

```bash
./easyge
```

## API token
To extend rate limits when using Easy-GE you can enter an optional API token when running the program.
This token is saved when entering an API token. Token can be generated on [this page](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
If you don't want to use an API token, then you can just press enter to skip it.

> [!WARNING]  
> This script will 100% delete a proton version if you use `3. Uninstall`.  
> That's the job of this script (duh). There is no turning back afterwards.
